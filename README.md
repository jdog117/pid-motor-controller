# BOARD
## PID Controller Board for Flywheel Stabilization
- ### Small form factor microcontroller for projects requiring PID control such as the self balancing flywheel done in this project
- ### STM32 ARM Cortex-M0+
- ### MC3630 Accelerometer
# DRIVERS
- ### Writen in C using STM32CubeIDE
- ### Programmable through JTAG probe
- ### Supports debugging
## Specifications
- STM32 (STM32C011F6U6TR) chip was used for low power consumption and its small size
- The PID board was designed in Altium with pads for soldering the flywheel motor to the board
