# BOARD
## PID Controller Board for Flywheel Stabilization
### Small form factor microcontroller for projects requiring PID control such as the self balancing flywheel done in this project
# DRIVERS
- ### Writen in C for this board
- ### Programmable through JTAG probe
- ### Supports debugging
## Specifications
STM32 (STM32C011F6U6TR) chip was used for low power consumption and size
The PID board was designed in Altium with pads for soldering the flywheel motor to the board
## Drivers
Drivers are written in C for ARM MUCs

## Improvements
- Mounting holes
- Status LED
